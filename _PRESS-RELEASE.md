There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  A web app that allows you to build and manage your restaurant wish-list.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  The market for this app is directed towards 'foodies', or in other words, people that are very interested in different restaurant spots that they have not had a chance to visit yet.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Scrumptious-List is a new app that allows any foodie to organize and manage their next food destinations. With tons of new and exciting eateries popping up, it can be hard to remember which ones you wanted to visit, or you may have delayed your visit depending on your cuisine preference that day. With scrumptious-list, you can search through restaurants and add them to your To-Visit list to keep track of them. Once added, you can add notes to each listing or add a level of priority to sort them. The next day you're hungry, you can simply check the app and find your next destination.


## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Many foodies do not have a single source for keeping their favorite food destinations organized.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  This application solves the problem by providing a single source that users can easily refer to that will concisely give them a list of restaurant destinations that they will visit next.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "It has never been so easy to keep track of your food-related priorities!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  1. Simply log onto the website
  2. Search for a restaurant, either by restaurant name or cuisine
  3. Select the restaurant to add it to your list
  4. manage list by removing items, or editing notes for each restaurant

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "Before I used this app, I would always forget to visit the taco spot that everyone raved about. Now I'll never have to worry about forgetting a new taco truck destination ever again!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
